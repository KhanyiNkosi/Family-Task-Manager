This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 🧹 Repository Cleanup Note

This repository contains several backup folders from development work (`app-backup-before-restore-170741`, `auth-backup-20260129-143931`, `backup_2026-01-26_21-37`, etc.). 

**Recommended**: Move these to an `/archive` directory or remove them to keep the repository clean. See [VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md](./VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md#backup--cleanup) for cleanup instructions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
